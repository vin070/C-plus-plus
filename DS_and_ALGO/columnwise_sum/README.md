**Column Wise Sum**

Given a 2D integer array of size M*N, find and print the sum of ith column elements separated by space.

**INPUT FORMAT** \
First and only line of input contains M and N, followed by M * N space separated integers representing the elements in the 2D array.

**OUTPUT FORMAT**\
Sum of every ith column elements (separated by space)

**CONSTRAINTS** \
1 <= M, N <= 10^3

**SAMPLE INPUT** \
4 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

**SAMPLE OUTPUT** \
16 20

**TIME COMPLEXITY** \
O(rows*column)
