**Remove character**

For a given a string(str) and a character X, write a function to remove all the occurrences of X from the given string.\
The input string will remain unchanged if the given character(X) doesn't exist in the 
input string.

**INPUT FORMAT**\
The first line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces.\
The second line of input contains a character(X) without any leading and trailing spaces.

**OUTPUT FORMAT**\
The only line of output prints the updated string.

**NOTE**\
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of.

**CONSTRAINTS**\
0 <= N <= 10^6\
Where N is the length of the input string.\
Time Limit: 1 second

**SAMPLE INPUT 1**\
aabccbaa\
a

**SAMPLE OUTPUT 1**\
bccb

**TIME COMPLEXITY**\
O(n) where n is length of string
