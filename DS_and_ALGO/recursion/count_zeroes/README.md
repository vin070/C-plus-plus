**INPUT FORMAT**\
Integer N

**OUTPUT FORMAT**\
Number of zeros in N

**CONSTRAINTS**\
0 <= N <= 10^9

**SAMPLE INPUT 1**\
0

**SAMPLE OUPUT 1**
1

**SAMPLE INPUT 2**
00010204

**SAMPLE OUPUT 1**
2\
Explanation for Sample Output 2 :\
Even though "00010204" has 5 zeros, the output would still be 2 because when you convert it to an integer, it becomes 

**TIME COMPLEXITY**\
O(n) where n number of digits in number
