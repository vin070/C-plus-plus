**All Indices of Number**

Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find all the indexes where x is present in the input array. Save all the indexes in an array (in increasing order).\
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

**INPUT FORMAT**\
Line 1 : An Integer N i.e. size of array\
Line 2 : N integers which are elements of the array, separated by spaces\
Line 3 : Integer x

**OUTPUT FORMAT**\
indexes where x is present in the array (separated by space)

**CONSTRAINTS**\
1 <= N <= 10^3

**SAMPLE INPUT**\
5\
9 8 10 8 8\
8

**SAMPLE OUTPUT**\
1 3 4

**TIME COMPLEXITY**\
O(n) where n is length of array
