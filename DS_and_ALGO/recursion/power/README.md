**Power**\

Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.

**INPUT FORMAT**\
Two integers x and n (separated by space)

**OUTPUT FORMAT**\
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)

**CONSTRAINTS**\
1 <= x <= 30\
0 <= n <= 30

**SAMPLE INPUT**\
3 4

**SAMPLE OUTPUT**\
18

**TIME COMPLEXITY**
O(n) where n is power
