**Write a program that asks the user for a number N and a choice C. And then give them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of all integers in the range 1 to N (both inclusive). \
If C is equal to - \
 1, then print the sum \ 
 2, then print the product \
 Any other number, then print '-1' (without the quotes)**

 **INPUT FORMAT** \
Line 1 : Integer N \
Line 2 : Choice C

**OUTPUT FORMAT** \
Sum/product/-1 according to user's choice

**CONSTRAINTS** \
1 <= N <= 12

**SAMPLE INPUT** \
10 \
1

**SAMPLE OUTPUT** \
55

**TIME COMPLEXITY**
O(n)
