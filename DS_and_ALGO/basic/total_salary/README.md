**Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -** \
totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf 

**Where:** \
hra   = 20% of basic \
da    = 50% of basic \
allow = 1700 if grade = 'A' \
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’ \
allow = 1300 if grade = 'C or any other character \
pf    = 11% of basic

Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.
