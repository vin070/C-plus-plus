**FIND POWER OF A NUMBER** \
Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.

**Note:** For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1.

**INPUT FORMAT** \
Two integers x and n (separated by space)

**OUTPUT FORMAT** \
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)

**Constraints:** \
0 <= x <= 8 \ 
0 <= n <= 9 

**SAMPLE INPUT** \
3 4

**SAMPLE OUTPUT** \
81
